## How to print

To make this float just right, you have to ensure the bottom 14 mm of the ghostie has 100% infill.

If you import the `.3mf` file into PrusaSlicer, this should happen automatically.

Otherwise, in PrusaSlicer, import the `.stl` file then:

- Print Settings → Infill → Fill density: 100%.

- Plater → Right click on floatie-ghostie.stl → Height Range Modifier

- Plater → Height ranges → Start at height: 14

- Plater → Height ranges → Stop at height: 42

- Plater → Right click on Range 14.00-42.00 (mm) → Infill

- Plater → Fill density: 15%.

- Plater → Fill pattern: Cubic.

Enjoy!
